# Decentrealized Web

The Decentrealized Web represents the evolution of the internet, in which data is rendered secure and immutable. The data is stored in the URL indefinitely, ensuring its perpetual availability. The data is further transformed into an AES-256 string, which serves as the fundamental building block for the secure infrastructure of the Decentrealized Web.

## What is it?
- It's like a super cool version of the internet
- Keeps your information safe and can't be deleted

## How does it work?
- Your information lives in the website address forever!
- Even if one network goes offline or deleted, the information can still be viewed from other networks

## What makes it safe?
- Protected by CryptoJS AES-256 Encryption
- Like a secret code that nobody can crack
- What ever you share it remains forever

## Why is it important?
- Keeps your information safe forever
- Ensures that important information is always accessible
- Helps preserve knowledge and culture for future generations

You can encrypt any text or html codes online and then view them anytime from any Decentrealized Web network at [decentrealizedweb.xyz](https://decentrealizedweb.xyz).

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ki-ask/decentrealizedweb.git
```

Then, navigate to the directory and start a local web server:

```
cd decentrealizedweb
php -S localhost:8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser to use the tool.

### Deploy on Vercel

You can deploy your own "Decentrealized Web" network on vercel for free.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/ki-ask/decentrealizedweb)

## Usage

To use the Decentrealized Web, write text or codes on editor and click the "Peace" button. The Decentrealized Web will encrypt text or codes and will generate an decentrealized web url, copy the url and save it to a secure place or share it with public if you want.

The generated link will be displayed on the page, and you can copy it to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- CryptoJS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Font-awesome
- Iconify
- Serverless PHP

## How Decentrealized Web Works

Decentrealized Web uses CryptoJS to decentrealized pages, page that can be decrypted in-browser when they visit the URL. You can then just rest assured that it never going to be erased untill all networks goes down, the most beautiful things that even all networks goes down then still if you deploy your own network then all data comes back to life again and you're done. The homepage will had a simple editor where you can write or paste pre-written text or html codes, and the cryptojs will encrypt and then it will decrypt and will load your HTML, all done in the browser and all that in one place which is called URL.

So it basically encrypts your text codes and puts everything in a user-friendly way to view your newly created uneraseable decentrealizedweb page.

## FAQ

### Is it secure?

Simple answer: Your page content has been encrypted with AES-256, a popular and strong encryption algorithm. You can now share it to any public place and no one will be able to modify or erase it even with your permission and even without your permission. After all thier is a web app called staticrypt which helps to protect text to be viewed publicly with a password protected form and it is also encrypted with AES-256.
